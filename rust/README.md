# About Rust
General-purpose programming language with an emphasis on performance, safety and especially safe concurrency. Rust offers both high-level features such as functional programming and mechanisms for low-level memory management.

## Projects
- src/main.rs - conversion of a simple text based adventure from Go to Rust

## Compiling and running
- `cargo build` builds the code according to Cargo.toml 
- `cargo run` executes the code 

#### Hello World
``` rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello World!");
}
```
